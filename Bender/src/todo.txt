add inline display
implement cascading style
    need to create hash for MatchedRule so we can compare parent rules to child rules
make HTML height and width the height and width of the window
refactor content variable name to border/padding
clean up factories
make styleoptions responsible for if they should cascade or not
need to make font-decoration a "styleoption" or something
    as it is now, can't cascade to child TextNode because it only styles the current node
